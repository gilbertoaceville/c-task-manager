# C Task Manager

Next.js application for managing tasks

## Process and Goal

The main process or reason for this project was not to just build a todo application, better ones can be found almost anywhere online.

I also added an authentication flow using Clerk Auth `@clerk/nextjs`

My favorite part with this project and the focus was to brush up on my `Prisma` skills, so building a simple task management app was a go to for me.

Database setup for the application is MongoDB

Just like a dev who I follow remarks "My main inspiration for this project was Github Project" and of course, getting up to speed with prisma

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

After cloning the project, you need to run `yarn install`, `yarn run dev` subsequently

This project uses 1 environment variable, a connection to mongodb atlas
<br>
Create a `.env` file in the root folder.
<br>
<br>
The environment variables it should have:
<br>
<br>
`DATABASE_URL`
<br>
